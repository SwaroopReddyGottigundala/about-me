Swaroop Reddy Gottigundala - Section-01 - Dr.  Denise Case/ 11am

Hello, i am a student of spring 2020 batch pursuing MS in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State university.

I am from hyderabad, India. I have pursued my under graduation major in Information technology from MLR Institute of Technology. After my bachelor's, I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at Mphasis pvt ltd for a year where i worked on a project for Charles Schwab Bank on Apk testing.

During that time period, I have seen the scope of Big data which droves through machine learning , So i thought by doing master's in that area would help me to improve my knowledge and wider perspective of career opportunities. 

Something interesting about me is that I am a foodie and like to travel a lot.
